      "Based on your preference for higher risk bets and a decent return, I recommend the following mutual fund:\n",

      "1.  **Fund Name: Scheme 144836**\n",
      "    *   **Explanation:** This fund appears to be a strong candidate for your investment goals. You mentioned being comfortable with some higher risk, and this fund's performance metrics suggest it has historically delivered excellent returns for the level of risk it takes.\n",
      "        *   **Why it suits your needs:**\n",
      "            *   **Higher Risk Tolerance:** While its market sensitivity (`beta` of 0.81) is slightly higher than some other options, it indicates that it might experience slightly larger movements in line with the overall market. This aligns with your comfort level for \"higher risk bets.\"\n",
      "            *   **Decent Return Potential:** This fund truly shines in its ability to generate returns. Its `alpha_annualized` of 0.34 is exceptionally high, meaning it has consistently outperformed what would be expected given its risk level. In simpler terms, it has shown a strong ability to generate extra returns beyond just following the market.\n",
      "            *   **Efficient Returns for Risk Taken:** The fund boasts very high `sharpe_ratio` (5.06) and `sortino_ratio` (9.93). These numbers indicate that for every unit of risk you take, especially considering the downside, this fund has historically provided a very good return. This means it's not just taking on risk, but it's being well-rewarded for it. Its `treynor_ratio` (0.63) also confirms its strong performance relative to market risk.\n",
      "        *   **In summary:** Scheme 144836 seems to be a good fit because it offers a balance of slightly higher market exposure (aligning with your risk comfort) while demonstrating a remarkable ability to generate significant returns efficiently, making it a strong contender for a \"decent return\" on your investment.\n"
